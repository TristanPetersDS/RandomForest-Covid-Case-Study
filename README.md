# Random Forest Case Study: COVID-19 Patient Classification

This project is a case study utilizing the **Random Forest Classifier** to analyze COVID-19 patient data. The study aims to predict patient outcomes based on various features. The dataset originates from South Korean COVID-19 case records provided on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kimjihoo/coronavirusdataset).

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
- Implements **Random Forest**, an ensemble learning method using decision trees.
- Uses COVID-19 patient data to predict patient **state** (condition).
- Demonstrates the role of **machine learning** in real-world health data analysis.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset contains COVID-19 patient information, including:
- Demographic details
- Medical history
- Infection sources and outcomes

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Random Forest Classifier
